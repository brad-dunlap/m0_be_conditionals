1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? I honestly just need repetitions of tasks to make sure I remember processes.

If I have questions, I will reach out to my small group and partners pairs. I have already built good relationships with all of those people and feel comfortable posting questions within the slack channel.
